# NodeJS
Node Intro & Understanding JavaScript Prototypes - Workshop

## Objective

The goal of these exercises was to extend my understanding of the object model (in Javascript) by learning how prototypes work.

Most guides / tutorials start explaining JavaScript objects by going directly to ‘__constructor functions__’, this workshop is different, it starts simple by explaining prototype chains and building from there.


## What I learned

- What are prototypes chains
- Message delegation in a prototype chain
- What are function constructors
- What are function prototypes and how to work with them

## Installation & Update

```
$ npm install -g planetproto@latest
```
